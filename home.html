		<div class="hvrbox-text">A web server is a computer system that processes requests via HTTP, the basic network protocol used to distribute information on the World Wide Web. The term can refer to the entire system, or specifically to the software that accepts and supervises the HTTP requests.</div>

		<div class="hvrbox-text">A DNS server is a computer server that contains a database of public IP addresses and their associated hostnames, and in most cases, serves to resolve, or translate, those common names to IP addresses as requested. DNS servers run special software and communicate with each other using special protocols.
		In more easy to understand terms: a DNS server on the internet is the device that translates that www.lifewire.com you type in your browser to the 151.101.129.121 IP address that it really is. Note: Other names for a DNS server include name server, nameserver and domain. </div>

		<div class="hvrbox-text">The most familiar type of routers are home and small office routers that simply pass IP packets between the home computers and the Internet. An example of a router would be the owner's cable or DSL router, which connects to the Internet through an Internet service provider (ISP). More sophisticated routers, such as enterprise routers, connect large business or ISP networks up to the powerful core routers that forward data at high speed along the optical fiber lines of the Internet backbone. Though routers are typically dedicated hardware devices, software-based routers also exist.</div>

Computer information is stored digitally, whereas information transmitted over telephone lines is transmitted in the form of analog waves. A modem converts between these two forms..</div>

		<div class="hvrbox-text">A network packet is a formatted unit of data carried by a packet-switched network. When data is formatted into packets, packet switching is possible and the bandwidth of the communication medium can be shared amoung users. A packet consists of control information and user data, which is also known as the payload. Control information provides data for delivering the source and destination network addresses, error detection codes, and sequencing information.</div>

		<div class="hvrbox-text">When a computer requests from a webpage, you enter a URL that is easy to understand and remember. For your computer to access the computer containing the pages, that URL must be converted into an IP address, which is done with DNS. Once DNS has converted the URL into an IP address, the routers on the Internet will know how to route your TCP/IP packet.</div>

		<div class="hvrbox-text">Static (fixed) cameras â€“ The camera and a flash unit are mounted on a single pole that has a footprint of about half a square metre along the roadway. These cameras use a dual radar system. Signals from the radars reflect off vehicles and back to the camera. One radar identifies speeding vehicles by measuring vehicle speed three times in quick succession and taking the middle speed. The second radar identifies the lane the vehicle is in and double-checks the speed reading. If the vehicle is speeding, the camera takes a picture. The camera is also able to differentiate between vehicles such as heavy trucks and cars which have different speed limits.</div>
